# Starbound Achievement Unlocker
Here is a Starbound mod that allows you to unlock all of Starbound's achievements by simply killing any creature in the game. Install the mod and then kill something to reap in the achievements.
## How to Build/Install
Use Starbound's asset packer in the command line to pack the entire folder of code into a `*.pak` file and place that file in `Starbound\mods`.
```
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Starbound\win32"
asset_packer.exe %PathToMod% ..\mods\AchievementUnlocker.pak
```
Don't forget to replace `%PathToMod%` with the complete path to your *Achievement Unlocker* folder!
